The `probly` Python package
===========================

`probly` is a Python package for **uncertainty representation** and **quantification** for machine learning.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`probly` is intended to work with **Python 3.10 and above**. Installation can be done via `pip` and
or `uv`:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install probly

or

.. code-block:: sh

   uv add probly

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`probly` makes it very easy to make models uncertainty-aware and perform several downstream tasks:

.. code-block:: python

   import probly
   import torch.nn.functional as F

   net = ... # get neural network
   model = probly.representation.Dropout(net) # make neural network a Dropout model
   train(model) # train model as usual

   data = ... # get data
   preds = model.predict_representation(data) # predict an uncertainty representation
   eu = probly.quantification.classification.mutual_information(preds) # compute model's epistemic uncertainty

   data_ood = ... # get out of distribution data
   preds_ood = model.predict_representation(data_ood)
   eu_ood = probly.quantification.classification.mutual_information(preds_ood)
   auroc = probly.tasks.out_of_distribution_detection(eu, eu_ood) # compute the AUROC score for out of distribution detection
