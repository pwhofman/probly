Examples
====================

This section contains executable examples and tutorials illustrating the
core concepts of uncertainty-aware machine learning and the functionality
provided by **probly**.

The examples are designed to complement the theoretical explanations given
in the *Core Concepts* and related sections of the documentation.

Structure
---------

The gallery is organized into the following types of examples:

- **Introductory examples**
  Simple toy setups that illustrate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

- **Representation examples**
  Demonstrations of different uncertainty representations such as samples,
  ensembles, evidential outputs, and predictive distributions.

- **Quantification examples**
  Examples showing how uncertainty representations are converted into
  numerical measures such as entropy, variance, and scoring rules.

- **Applied tutorials**
  End-to-end tutorials for tasks like out-of-distribution detection,
  selective prediction, calibration, and risk-aware decision making.

How to use the examples
-----------------------

Each example is fully executable and consists of:

- A short explanation in the header
- The complete Python source code
- Automatically generated figures and outputs

You can use these examples as a starting point for your own experiments or
as references for integrating uncertainty-aware methods into real-world
machine learning pipelines.
