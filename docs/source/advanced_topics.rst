1. Overview
-----------

1.1 Purpose of this chapter
This chapter explains:

- what “advanced” means in the context of *probly*,
- when you should read this chapter (recommended after Core Concepts and Main Components).

1.2 Prerequisites & notation
Before reading this chapter, the reader should already be familiar with:

- the concepts introduced in Core Concepts,  
- the basic workflows described in Main Components,  
- foundational ideas such as uncertainty representations, transformations, and inference.

For clarity, this chapter follows the same notation conventions used throughout the Probly documentation.

1.3 Typical advanced use cases
This chapter is intended for scenarios where users go beyond simple toy examples, such as:

- training or evaluating large or real-world models,  
- dealing with tight performance or memory constraints,  
- integrating Probly into existing machine-learning pipelines.

These use cases often require a deeper understanding of transformations, scalability, and framework interoperability, which this chapter provides.
