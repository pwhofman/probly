Introduction
============

This page gives a gentle, high-level overview of what `probly` is and why 
uncertainty is an important topic in modern machine learning. It is meant as
a starting point for new users before they continue reading the rest of the User Guide, which 
covers everything from installation and quickstart examples to core concepts, main components,
advanced topics, and hands-on tutorials. The aim is to equip readers with the conceptual background needed
to understand and apply the more detailed material presented in later sections.
