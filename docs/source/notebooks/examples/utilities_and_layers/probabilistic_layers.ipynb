    "# Key Probabilistic Layers in `probly`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `BayesLinear` & `BayesConv2d`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they do:**\n",
    "These layers replace standard `Linear` and `Conv2d` layers to build a **Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How they work:**\n",
    "Instead of using fixed weights, each weight is modeled as a probability distribution (e.g., Gaussian).\n",
    "On every forward pass, weights are sampled from these distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "The model can explicitly represent **uncertainty in its own parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `DropConnectLinear`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "Implements the **DropConnect** technique as a neural network layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "During training (and during inference when performing uncertainty quantification), individual weights are randomly set to zero.\n",
    "This is a more general form of Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "Running multiple forward passes produces a **distribution of outputs** that captures model uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `NormalInverseGammaLinear` (for Evidential Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "A specialized output layer designed for **Evidential Regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Instead of predicting a single value, the layer outputs the four parameters of a **Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG)** distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gamma`\n",
    "- `nu`\n",
    "- `alpha`\n",
    "- `beta`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "This distribution directly models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The predictive mean\n",
    "- The predictive variance\n",
    "- The model’s confidence in its own predictions\n"
