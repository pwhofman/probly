    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical introduction to the core utility functions in `probly`.\n",
    "These helpers are essential building blocks for training probabilistic models and quantifying uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model traversal functions**, which inspect a model’s architecture\n",
    "- **Uncertainty quantification functions**, which compute meaningful uncertainty scores from model predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. `collect_kl_divergence` (for BNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "Automatically traverses a Bayesian Neural Network and sums the KL divergence from each Bayesian layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s useful:**\n",
    "This function is critical for computing the **ELBO loss** during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `total_entropy`, `conditional_entropy`, `mutual_information`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they do:**\n",
    "These functions take a set of predictions (for example, from an ensemble) and decompose predictive uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why they’re useful:**\n",
    "They allow you to separately measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aleatoric uncertainty** (inherent randomness in the data)\n",
    "- **Epistemic uncertainty** (uncertainty due to limited model knowledge)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `evidential_uncertainty` (for Evidential Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "Computes an uncertainty score directly from the **evidence vector** produced by an evidential model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s useful:**\n",
    "It provides a fast, single-pass way to determine whether a model is uncertain about its prediction.\n"
