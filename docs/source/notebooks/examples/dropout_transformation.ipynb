    "## 1. Concept: What is Dropout (normal) vs Dropout Transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The original question for this part is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“What is Dropout (normal) vs Dropout Transformation?”**\n",
    "> **1.1 Normal Dropout (no probly, just PyTorch)**\n",
    "> In “normal” deep learning, Dropout is a layer used during training to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "> Overfitting = model memorizes training data and sucks on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a more detailed version of that explanation, in my own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Normal Dropout (standard PyTorch Dropout layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a neural network, there is always the risk of **overfitting**. That means the model becomes\n",
    "very good at the training set but fails on new data, because it has more or less *memorised* patterns that\n",
    "only appear in the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal Dropout** is a simple trick to make overfitting less likely. During training, a `Dropout(p)` layer\n",
    "will, for every mini‑batch, randomly set a fraction `p` of its input activations to zero. You can imagine\n",
    "this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- with probability `p` a neuron is “switched off” for this training step,\n",
    "- with probability `1 − p` it behaves as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different neurons get switched off in every step, the network is forced to **spread the information**\n",
    "across many neurons instead of relying on a few very strong ones. This usually makes the model **more robust**\n",
    "and helps it generalise better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important detail: in **normal PyTorch usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout is **active only in training mode** (`model.train()`),\n",
    "- and it is **disabled in evaluation mode** (`model.eval()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "So at test / inference time, the model behaves like a **deterministic function**: the same input always gives\n",
    "the same output, and there is no randomness from Dropout anymore. The purpose of normal Dropout is therefore\n",
    "*only* to improve generalisation during training, not to provide uncertainty information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Dropout Transformation (probly)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Dropout transformation** in `probly` takes this Dropout idea and uses it in a slightly different role.\n",
    "Instead of treating Dropout purely as a regularisation trick during training, we use it to make the model\n",
    "**uncertainty‑aware** at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, the transformation does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It walks through your PyTorch model and finds the relevant linear layers.\n",
    "- It programmatically inserts Dropout layers around those linear layers.\n",
    "- Crucially, these Dropout layers stay **active during inference**, so each forward pass is a bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now feed the **same input** through the transformed model multiple times, we do **not** get exactly the\n",
    "same output each time. Instead we get a *cloud* of slightly different predictions. From this cloud we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- compute a mean prediction (what the model “on average” thinks), and\n",
    "- look at how much the predictions vary (this variation is a proxy for **uncertainty**).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the Dropout transformation reuses the usual Dropout mechanism, but with a **different goal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- normal Dropout: better training, less overfitting, Dropout OFF in eval mode;\n",
    "- Dropout transformation: keep Dropout ON in eval mode to get a distribution of outputs and estimate how\n",
    "  confident the model is.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Part A, we explored how Dropout works in deep learning and how the Dropout Transformation extends that idea in `probly`. Normal Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to reduce overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons, forcing the model to learn more general patterns. However, it is disabled during inference, making the model’s predictions deterministic. The Dropout Transformation, in contrast, keeps dropout active during inference, allowing the model to produce slightly different outputs for the same input. This variability reveals how confident or uncertain the model is about its predictions. In short, Part A explained the conceptual shift from using dropout purely for training robustness to using it as a tool for estimating predictive uncertainty.\n"

    "This tutorial showed how the concept of **Dropout** can evolve from a simple regularization technique into a foundation for **uncertainty-aware deep learning**.\n",
    "We began by understanding how dropout reduces overfitting by randomly turning off neurons during training, helping models learn more general patterns.\n",
    "From there, we extended this idea to the **Dropout Transformation** in `probly`, where dropout remains active during inference.\n",
    "By running multiple stochastic forward passes, the model reveals not only its predictions but also how confident it is about them.\n",
    "Through this process, we transformed dropout from a tool that improves generalization into one that also provides valuable insight into a model’s **confidence and reliability**, bridging the gap between stable learning and interpretable uncertainty.\n",
