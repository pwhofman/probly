    "While numerical metrics provide a quantitative measure of uncertainty, visualizations offer an intuitive, qualitative understanding of a model's predictions. A single plot can often reveal the nature of a model's confidence in a way that is difficult to grasp from numbers alone. To this end, probly provides specialized tools for plotting predictive distributions, focusing on classification tasks.\n",

    "Currently, the plotting module is designed to visualize the outputs of 3-class classifiers on a 2D simplex. This is a triangle where each corner represents 100% confidence in one of the three classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library provides two main functions for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Simplex Plot is used to scatter individual predictions on this triangle, allowing you to see the distribution of a model's predictions across a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Credal Set Plot is a more advanced tool for visualizing the uncertainty of a single prediction derived from multiple samples (e.g., from an ensemble or MC-Dropout). It plots the region of all possible probability distributions consistent with the model's outputs. A small, tight region indicates high confidence, while a large, spread-out region signifies high uncertainty.\n",

    "- **Spider plot** / `plot_multid`: Multi-class probability diagnostics when `n_classes > 3`: compact views to spot systematic uncertainty patterns across many classes.\n",

    "- `plot_dirichlet`: Plots **Dirichlet density contours** on the ternary simplex to illustrate “distributions over probabilities” (concentration, symmetry, and skew).\n",
