    "##  1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are powerful, but standard neural networks cannot express uncertainty about their predictions. In many applications—such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, or other safety-critical systems—it is important to know *how confident* a model is in its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, **neural network ensembles** are used to estimate uncertainty because they capture both:\n",
    "- **Data uncertainty (aleatoric uncertainty)** → noise inherent in the data\n",
    "- **Knowledge uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty)** → model ignorance, OOD inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ensembles are **computationally expensive**, because they require running **many neural networks** at inference time. This makes them impractical for real-world systems that need fast predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, **Prior Networks** were introduced for **classification tasks**. Instead of predicting class probabilities directly (e.g., through a softmax layer), Prior Networks predict the parameters of a **Dirichlet distribution**, allowing a single model to mimic the uncertainty behavior of an entire ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea was later extended to continuous outputs in **Regression Prior Networks (Malinin et al., 2020)**, which use a **Normal–Wishart prior** and produce **Student-t predictive distributions**. These models allow single-network uncertainty estimation for regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand why ensembles provide strong uncertainty\n",
    "- Explain why ensembles are expensive at inference\n",
    "- Show how Prior Networks solve the ensemble cost problem\n",
    "- Explain how **classification Prior Networks** work (Dirichlet priors)\n",
    "- Explain how **Regression Prior Networks** work (Normal–Wishart priors → Student-t output)\n",
    "- Show how this relates to **Evidential Deep Learning (Sensoy et al., 2018)**\n"

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Shape of a Student-t distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter **ν** (nu, degrees of freedom) controls how heavy the tails are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small ν → *very heavy tails* (uncertain)\n",
    "- Medium ν → *moderately heavy* (some uncertainty)\n",
    "- Large ν → approaches a Normal distribution (confident)\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- ν = 1 → Cauchy distribution (extremely heavy-tailed)\n",
    "- ν = 3 → high uncertainty\n",

    "- ν → ∞ → Normal distribution\n",

    "- if models disagree → tail gets heavier → epistemic uncertainty rises\n",
    "- if data is noisy → variance stays large → aleatoric uncertainty\n",
