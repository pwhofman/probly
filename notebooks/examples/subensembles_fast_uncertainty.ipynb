    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach to obtaining high-quality estimates are **Full Ensembles**, where multiple neural networks are trained independently and their predictions are combined. While Full Ensembles are simple and highly effective, they come with substantial computational and memory cost: each model requires full training and storage. This makes them difficult to use in resource-constrained environments or during fast model development cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, recent research\n",
    "> [Deep Sub-Ensembles for Fast Uncertainty Estimation in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08168)\n",
    "\n",
    "has proposed **Sub-Ensembles**, a technique that retains the predictive benefits of Full Ensembles while drastically reducing training time and interference overhead. Instead of training multiple full models, Sub-Ensembles share a large portion of the network (the backbone) and create several lightweight, partially independent branches (heads). These branches act as an ensemble member, providing diversity at a fraction of the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the notebook is to:\n",
    "- introduce the core idea behind (Sub-)Ensembles,\n",
    "- evaluate their ability to estimate predictive uncertainty,\n",
    "- demonstrate how they can be implemented in practice."

    "offer a method where multiple models are trained independently and their predictions are combined to improve uncertainty quantification. The idea is that by aggregating the outputs of several models, we can reduce variance, improve robustness and achieve better generalization than a single model. Ensembles are particularly effective where individual models are prone to overfitting or high variance."

    "\n",
    "A **Sub-Ensemble** generates multiple subnetworks from a single base model. This can be achieved by dividing a neural network into two subnetworks, the trunk network $T$ and the task network $K$. The full output for an input $x$ then is $K(T(x))$.\n",
    "Since all subnetworks share the same base feature extractor (**backbone**), instead of training multiple independent neural networks from scratch, the forward pass is much faster compared to evaluating multiple fully independent networks.\n",
