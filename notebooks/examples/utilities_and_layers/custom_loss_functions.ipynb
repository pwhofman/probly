    "# `probly` Tutorial — Custom Loss Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical introduction to the specialized loss functions in `probly`. While standard losses like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` are sufficient for deterministic models, probabilistic models often require custom loss functions to handle uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover three key types of custom losses:\n",
    "-   **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) Losses:** Adaptations for probabilistic outputs.\n",
    "-   **Evidential Losses:** Specialized functions for models that learn \"evidence.\"\n",
    "-   **Calibration-Aware Losses:** Losses that directly optimize for model calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) Losses\n",
    "NLL losses are a foundational concept in training probabilistic models. Instead of just penalizing wrong predictions, they evaluate how well the entire predicted *distribution* explains the true target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The ELBO Loss for Bayesian Neural Networks\n",
    "A Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) requires a unique loss function that balances two goals:\n",
    "1.  **Fit the data:** Make accurate predictions (similar to a standard loss).\n",
    "2.  **Stay simple:** Keep the weight distributions close to a simple prior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)** loss achieves this."

    "## 3. Calibration-Aware Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the most effective way to achieve good calibration is to include a calibration objective directly in the loss function.  \n",
    "This forces the model to optimize calibration as part of training.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Label Relaxation** is a simple but effective technique for reducing over-confidence and improving model calibration.  \n",

    "\n",

    "- The remaining probability mass (e.g., `0.1`) is distributed across the other classes.\n",

    "The `probly` library provides a direct implementation of this approach through the **`LabelRelaxationLoss`**.\n",
