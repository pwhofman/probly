    "# `probly` Tutorial — Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical introduction to the evaluation metrics available in `probly`. While standard accuracy is important, it doesn't tell the whole story about a model's performance, especially for probabilistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover three key types of metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proper Scoring Rules:** Metrics like Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) that evaluate the quality of the entire predicted probability distribution.\n",
    "- **Calibration Metrics:** Metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) that measure how well a model's predicted confidence aligns with its actual accuracy.\n",
    "- **Sharpness Metrics:** Metrics like efficiency and coverage that evaluate the precision and reliability of set-valued (uncertain) predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Proper Scoring Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper scoring rules are loss functions that evaluate the quality of a predictive distribution. They don't just care about whether the top-1 prediction is correct; they penalize a model for being confidently wrong and reward it for being accurately uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common proper scoring rule is the **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)**, also known as **Log Loss**.\n"
