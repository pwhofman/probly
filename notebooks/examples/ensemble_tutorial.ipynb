    "\n",

    "# 0. What is an Ensemble?\n",
    "An *ensemble* in machine learning is usually a method that uses a finite set of learning algorithms. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble combines the results of several models to create a better result.\n",
    "Those different models usually slightly differ in their parameters.\n",
    "This often improves robustness and helps quantify **uncertainty** — for example, when the ensemble members disagree, we know the model is unsure.  \n",
    "In `probly`, the `ensemble` transformation automates the creation of such model collections directly from a base PyTorch model. <br>\n",
    "**Why use `ensemble`?** <br>\n",
    "Because it saves you from having to manually copy, reset, and manage multiple model instances yourself. `ensemble` does all of that for you automatically."

    "- `common.py`: defines a generic dispatcher (`ensemble_generator`) and a user-facing API `ensemble()`.\n",

    "The `ensemble` function is a powerful dispatcher that abstracts away the complexity of creating model ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By registering type-specific generators (like `generate_torch_ensemble` for `nn.Module`) with the `ensemble_generator`, it provides a clean, extensible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the PyTorch implementation uses `pytraverse` to efficiently traverse, copy, and optionally reset parameters of the module structure. This demonstrates how the abstract concepts from `pytraverse_tutorial.ipynb` (like `singledispatch_traverser` and `traverse` with `{CLONE: True}`) are used in a real-world application to write robust and maintainable code."
