    This function iterates through all the modules in the given model and counts
    how many of them match the specified layer type. It's particularly useful
    for analyzing the architecture of a neural network or verifying its
    composition.

    Parameters:
        model: The neural network model containing the layers to be counted.
        layer_type: The type of layer to count within the model.

    Returns:
        The number of layers of the specified type found in the model.
